    <h1>Writing Genres</h1>
    <p>Below I've listed the preferred genres I enjoy writing about. I've only attempted to write within the scope of the mentioned genres, so I can only speak for my personal experience.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Fantasy</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons to love fantasy writing. As a fantasy writer, you are essentially a deity creating an entirely new world, which can be as original or as familiar as you like. You can create a world with its own cultures, religions, politics, history, creatures. magic and more. An interesting fantasy world should create a sense of worldbuilding that explains how all these different elements shape one another. This creates a sense of immersion for the reader as the world becomes more tangible in their mind. Inspiration for fantasy can be found through our own real world history, as well as the plethora of fantasy works that have released since the genre's inception.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Horror</h2>
    <p>Horror is a genre that works well with others, and often what people find frightening can be subjective. It can go well with science fiction, mystery, romance, thriller and many other genres. To me, the best horror immerses you to the extent that the scenario that is set is believable. That involves incorporating familiar environments but compromising them so that they don't feel comfortable. Personally, I prefer writing horror that utilises supernatural elements within familiar scenarios.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Science Fiction</h2>
    <p>Science fiction is a genre I enjoy but often feel too intimidated to write about. This is primarily because good science fiction writers like to use some degree of real world science in their works. This also lends the works some degree of realism, whilst giving established rules based around the fictional science created in-universe. Similar rules can be incorporated into magic systems in fantasy, but with science fiction it is often more palatable to make the rules relate to real world science.</p>
