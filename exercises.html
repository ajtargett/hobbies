    <h1>Favourite Exercises</h1>
    <p>This list will go over my personal favourite exercises, with a brief explanation as to why they are my favourites. I also love strength training specifically. I'm not too interested in obtaining a bodybuilder physique, rather I just enjoy training specific exercises. That being said, anyone reading should not attempt such exercises without knowing the limitations of their body first. I also tend to prioritise compound exercises over isolation based movements.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Pull Ups/Chin Ups</h2>
    <p>Often referred to as king of the upper body exercises. The pullup primarily targets the back, shoulders, biceps and lats. It's a compound movement that engages various muscle groups. Unfortunately, due to my recently gained weight and lack of exercise during lockdown, I'm not as proficient at them as I used to be, but it's a great exercise that can help you acuire strength quickly with enough practice. The chin up variant puts more emphasis on your biceps. Another great thing about pullups is their versatility. Your hand positioning and the width of your grip will affect what muscle groups are engaged.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Dips</h2>
    <p>Sometimes referred to as the squat of the upper body, dips are amazing for arm development. They engage your triceps and chest primarily, and your angle whilst performing them can determine how much you are targeting one or the other. Like pullups, you can add weight through a weightbelt or placing a dumbell between your legs should you get good enough at them</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Bench Press</h2>
    <p>The bench press is another exercise that is amazing for chest and tricep development. There's a degree of versatility with the bench press as well, with incline bench press, decline bench press and narrow grip bench press all helping to target muscles differently.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Deadlift</h2>
    <p>The greatest test of general body strength, the deadlift should be the exercise that allows you to lift the most weight possible for your body. It primarily targets the forearms, glutes, lower back and thighs, but it engages most of the muscles in your body. For this reason, it will promote some of the greatest strength gains should you add it to your workout regime. It can be performed with a straight bar or hexagon/trap bar. I prefer the hex bar personally. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who suffers from back pain.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Farmer's Walk</h2>
    <p>Similar to the deadlift in terms of the muscles worked, the farmer's walk either utilises a hexagon/trap bar or a set of dumbells. It's a rather simple exercise that involves walking whilst holding a large amount of weight. It means you get some cardiovascular engagement whilst also developing your grip strength. It's not dissimilar from carrying heavy shopping bags after a large shopping trip, only you can probably load more weight on a hex bar.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Prowler Sled</h2>
    <p>This exercise relies on a particular set of equipment. A prowler sled is a piece of gym equipment you push along the ground. The weight can be adjusted by adding weights to the bars of the sled. This exercise is great for developing explosive power in your legs. Out of all exercises, this is probably the one that tires me the most on both a cardiovascular and strength based level.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Preacher Curls</h2>
    <p>Probably the only isolation exercise on this list, but I tend to prefer arm based exercises. This exercise targets the biceps in a strict fashion.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h1>Cardiovascular Exercise</h1>
    <p>I don't tend to enjoy cardiovascular exercises, but I recognise their importance for overall health. HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), swimming and Boxing are some of my personal favourite cardio based exercises.</p>
