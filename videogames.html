    <h1>Favourite Videogames</h1>
    <p>Videogames are also one of my favourite pastimes. Like I mention on my writing page, a lot of my favourite games are in the genre of fantasy RPGs, as I tend to enjoy games that offer a degree of choice and flexibiliy in gameplay.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Divinity: Original Sin 2</h2>
    <p>A turn based CRPG (classic RPG), this game offers a great amount of flexibility in terms of character design and abilities. Two playthroughs can be entirely different depending on the abilities and companions you choose. For newcomers to CRPGs, the user interface and control scheme can seem a little overwhelming, but the depth of the combat and the amount of content within the game is worth getting accustomed to the game.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>The Elder Scrolls Series</h2>
    <p>The Elder Scrolls games are almost unparalelled in terms of exploration and content overall. With the PC based modding scene, there's a massive wealth of content to add to each respective game. My personal favourite of the series is Oblivion in terms of its setting and the questlines available, but all the entries I have played (Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim) have been fun and engaging experiences that can consume many hours.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</h2>
    <p>By far, the best aspect of this game is its combat. You can climb colossal monsters and hack away at them, as well as utilise a variety of abilities unique to nine distinct classes with their own strengths. With a large open world to explore, as well as a variety of quests and equipment to obtain, there's a lot of content to enjoy. There's also the challenging Bitterblack Isle DLC which offers the hardest content in the game.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Fallout Series</h2>
    <p>Another RPG, though this time set in the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout. With a futuristic 50s Americana aesthetic, it offers a unique setting for a world destroyed by nuclear war. I have only played the more recent fallout games which play like first person shooters, as opposed to the older games that resemble the more classic RPG format. Like the Elder Scrolls series (which is developed by the same company), the games have an emphasis on exploration.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</h2>
    <p>The Monster Hunter games essentially play like a boss rush mode where you have to kill giant creatures and scavenge their body parts to create armour and weapons of escalating power in relation to the difficulty of the monster. There are various different weapon classes to play around with as well as associated skillsets for armour and weapons. It's also multiplayer, which allows you to hunt with up to four friends.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</h2>
    <p>The Stalker games are set in Chernobyl, inspired by the book "Roadside Picnic", a Soviet-Russian book penned by Arkady and Strugatsky. The story revolves around mercenaries known as 'Stalkers' and several other factions who enter the exclusion zone established around Chernobyl in order to obtain strange artefacts produced by the zone. Each zone is dripping with atmosphere and teeming with deadly mutants, anomalies and bandits. At times it can feel more like a horror game than a hardcore FPS.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Witcher 3</h2>
    <p>Set in a world based off of the books of the same name, the Witcher 3 is a game where almost every side quest seems significant in some way. It has an expansive, beautiful world with well written characters and stories. I had never experienced a game where almost every side quest makes you feel invested until I played The Witcher 3.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Silent Hill 2</h2>
    <p>An absolute masterpiece - this game set the standard for psychological horror games. The story follows a man named James Sunderland who recieves a letter from his dead wife, telling him to follow her to Silent Hill. What follows is a world twisting around his damaged psyche, producing horrendous monstrosities.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Dark Souls Series</h2>
    <p>Dark souls is a series famed for its difficulty and brooding atmosphere. Set in a dying fantasy world, there's little story directly told to you. Instead, the story of this dying world is revealed through characters, item descriptions and environments. The gameplay is fun, yet methodical and timing based. It is also dependent on the weapons, magic and armour you choose to equip.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Timesplitters Series</h2>
    <p>There's very few games that offer as much variety and enjoyment as the Timesplitters series. Each entry boasts more game modes than any modern FPS without any microtransactions involved. There's so much unlockable content and the gameplay is incredibly fun. In terms of value, this game ranks as one of the best for getting the most out of a game.</p>
